# What is Root or Root Access to an Android device
Root access on an Android device is similar to administrator access on a computer (Access as Root user in an Android device). It gives you complete control over your device's operating system, allowing you to:
- modify system files
- install custom software.
- perform actions that are otherwise restricted by the manufacturer.

Default, the EndUser doesn't have the access permission as Root user in an Android devices. 
For instances, I use ADB command to access to devices and try to switch to Root user, but I can NOT do that step.

If you don't know ADB command, you can refer to these documents:
- ADB command from Android developer: https://developer.android.com/tools/adb
- ADB command in my blog: https://josdoaitran.github.io/testing4everyone-ht-install-adb-command-in-mac/
