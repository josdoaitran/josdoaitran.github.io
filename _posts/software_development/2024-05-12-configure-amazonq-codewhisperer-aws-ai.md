# üìë¬†Configuration CodeWhisperer

As tutorial post, this post will be mentioned with Personal purpose configuration steps for initializing setup CodeWhisperer Vs Code and JetBrains with **AWS Builder ID login.**

### Prerequisite

Probably, You need to have an AWS Account to use Amazon CodeWhisperer. In cases, you are working on your company and use AWS account that your company provided you. You have to align with your manager and request to enable Code Whisperer on your account.

In order to sign-up an AWS account, you can refer to this site and follow the on-boarding steps to have an AWS account: [https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/)

And y***ou sign-in your AWS Account on your default browser application on your computer via this link***: 
[Link To Sign-in AWS Account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3FhashArgs%3D%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue%26nc1%3Df_ct%26src%3Dfooter-signin%26state%3DhashArgsFromTB_eu-north-1_0a30a4663d630901&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Asignin%3A%3A%3Aconsole%2Fcanvas&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=zztlBkYRaIfS8d_MtQFOQbQwR2a8ZlS30yEUdcER5CQ&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)

This step is deeply important to sign-in your AWS Account via AWS BuilderID for AWS Toolkit

### Configure AWS plugin / extension

We need to install AWS Toolkit plugin or Extension on your Editor Code (Visual Code and JetBrain)

- Visual Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Jetrain: IntelliJ, PyCharm: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

AWS ToolKit for Visual Code: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode)
