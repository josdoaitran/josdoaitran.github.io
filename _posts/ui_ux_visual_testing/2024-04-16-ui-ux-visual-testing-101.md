UI & UX - Visual Testing

In this note, I would like to collect all information about User Interface and User Experiences for a software, what we should consider to build a software with good quality.

## UI and UX testing - Visual Testing

In software testing, we have the non-functional testing to collect all testing types that we don‚Äôt concentrate on the workflow, functions and the way that our software is working.

- And UI & UX testing is an important part of non-functional testing.
- It is more essential points for us, if we are software development teams to build our owned products.
    
    Probably, we don‚Äôt expect that UI Issues, errors occur and the End-User can see it.
    
    And, If UX of our software is friendly and easy to use, it is very helpful for us to keep our End-User stay with our product.
    
    We also have the mission to verify that the UI of our mobile build is displaying correct the UI design: Font, Color, Spacing, Sizing, ‚Ä¶ even Layout of our Mobile UI.

## Tools for Software Testing

Definitely, we can‚Äôt use our eye to verify the visual UI of our mobile build. it‚Äôs easy to miss cases due to human error.

We should use the tools instead of ***depending on personal judgment.***

### Manual Testing - Visual Testing - Compare with Design

- **Android Application**: We can use Layout Inspector [https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/layout-inspector](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/layout-inspector)
- **iOS Application**:  We have: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/accessibility-inspector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/accessibility-inspector)

or we can use 3rd party tool: [https://lookin.work/](https://lookin.work/)
