# About Premium Course with me

In this page, I would like to collect all courses with free sharing or tutorial video (From basic to advance course or knowledge) that I shared and will share on my personal Youtube channel (Testing4Everyone youtube channel - Vietnamese).

However, In order to ***improve the quality of some courses*** and ***save the personal license of some source code***. Some of special courses (or videos) or resources (Source Code) will be shared as the private videos. They are ***not free***, but ***you can access them with an affordable price.***

All revenues from premium course or private resource will be reinvested to help me to have the budget to maintain my Youtube Channel and enhance more the quality of my video.
