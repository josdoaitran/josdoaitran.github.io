# About DeepSeek
[https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-deepseek-why-is-it-disrupting-ai-sector-2025-01-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-deepseek-why-is-it-disrupting-ai-sector-2025-01-27/)
- DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence company founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, specializing in open-source large language models (LLMs). Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the company operates under the legal name Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd.

- In January 2025, DeepSeek released its AI assistant, DeepSeek-R1, which quickly surpassed ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in the United States. The model has been praised for its efficiency, achieving performance comparable to leading AI models at a fraction of the development cost. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 was developed using approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs over 55 days, costing around $5.58 millionâ€”significantly less than the hundreds of millions typically spent by competitors.

- The open-source nature of DeepSeek's models allows businesses to use and modify them without fees, though substantial computing power and expertise are required. However, concerns have been raised about data security and potential censorship, as the AI system operates under Chinese regulations. Tests have shown that DeepSeek-R1 avoids politically sensitive topics, reflecting the oversight of Chinese authorities.

- The emergence of DeepSeek has had a significant impact on the global tech industry, leading to a substantial decline in the market value of major tech companies. For instance, Nvidia's valuation dropped by $600 billion in a single day following DeepSeek-R1's release. This development has been described as a "Sputnik moment" for American AI, highlighting China's rapid advancements in the field.

- Despite its impressive capabilities, DeepSeek-R1 has limitations, particularly in handling politically sensitive topics. For example, it avoids discussions on events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and issues related to Taiwan's political status. Additionally, there are concerns about data privacy, as the AI system's terms indicate that user data may be stored on servers located in China, potentially subjecting it to government surveillance.

- In summary, DeepSeek represents a significant advancement in AI development, offering powerful and cost-effective models. However, potential users should carefully consider the associated data security and censorship concerns before integrating DeepSeek's technology into their operations.
