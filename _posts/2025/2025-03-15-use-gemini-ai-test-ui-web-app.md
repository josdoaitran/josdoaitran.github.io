Idea: Use Gemini AI as an assistant to help us boost work productivity. In this post I would like to share you the way to use Gemini to help us improve UI and Visual Testing.

This post will guide you through practical techniques and strategies for using Gemini to automate to generate the checklist for UI testing for a web application, improve accuracy, and ultimately, deliver higher-quality software faster.  Get ready to experience a significant leap forward in your development workflow.

# Create a simple UI checklist with Gemini 
Use Gemini to generate UI checklist to cover UI and Visual Testing
In the real project, we will have a design file example: Figma to define the designed element information, How your web application should be developed in UI view.
Due to no private disclosure, we don't have a specify UI design. I use Google search page as an example case as below image as based image.

I attached the Google search page screenshot to ask Gemini help me generate the checklist as bellow:

```textmate
I have a UI design for a web page as this image.
Could you provide the checklist to cover UI testing this page ?
```
And here is the result from Gemini:
