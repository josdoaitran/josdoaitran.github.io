In this post, I would like to share with you the way that you interact with me via my personal blog.
Currently, My blog is being developed in Github free host, Pipeline. Therefore, I take advantages of Github feature and plugin to  build up the essential feature for my personal blog sites.

After I spent 1 day to research I had a decision to integrate my current blog: [https://josdoaitran.github.io](https://josdoaitran.github.io) with a plugin as: [giscus](https://github.com/giscus)

- Whenever you want to give me your questions or any suggestion in each my post. You can navigate to the bottom of a page. And you can see the comment block as bellow:
