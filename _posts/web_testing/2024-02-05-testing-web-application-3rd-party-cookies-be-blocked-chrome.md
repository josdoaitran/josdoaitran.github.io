> **About Testing aspect, you should have the plans to perform testing to assure that your web application testing is still working once 3rd party cookies will be blocked.
It is really important if your application integrates with a several 3rd party cookies.**

# How we can perform testing

We can cover this testing by 2 ways: **Manual testing** (Enable blocked all 3rd cookies on your Chrome and Go through all features of your application) and **Automation testing** with several of automation testing framework, we can enable the mode to block all 3rd party cookie, and take advantages of automation testing to cover testing. On this post, I draft the **example code to disable 3rd party Cookies** 

## Manual testing by enable block all 3rd party on Chrome

- Open new tab on your Chrome browser  and navigate to this link:

```
chrome://flags/#test-third-party-cookie-phaseout
```

![walking]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/web-testing/testing-web-application-3rd-party-cookies-be-blocked-chrome/Untitled 2.png)

We have to change the value from **Disable** to **Enable,** and restart your browser

![walking]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/web-testing/testing-web-application-3rd-party-cookies-be-blocked-chrome/Untitled 3.png)

From now, you can switch enable or disable mode to allow 3rd third-party when you access to a site with these steps.

Example, I access to https://amazon.com

- Click on View Site Information of URL panel of Chrome browser

![walking]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/web-testing/testing-web-application-3rd-party-cookies-be-blocked-chrome/Untitled 4.png)

Click on Cookies and site data:

![walking]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/web-testing/testing-web-application-3rd-party-cookies-be-blocked-chrome/Untitled 5.png)

On this panel, you can enable again to allow 3rd cookies, It looks like however it should consider this message:

**After we disable all 3rd party cookies on Chrome browser, we can execute all essential test cases to assure your web application still working well or not**

In order to verify that all 3rd party cookies are blocked or not, you can open Developer mode  and Element tab with Console. you can see the alert **‚ÄúReading third-party cookie is blocked‚Äù**

## Automation testing - Launch a WebDriver with mode: block all 3rd party on Chrome

Here are some examples of how "profile.block_third_party_cookies" is used:

- Python - Selenium:
    
    ```
    "profile.block_third_party_cookies": True
    ```
    
- Serenity:
    
    ```
    "profile.block_third_party_cookies="true"
    ```
    
- Java - Selenium
    
    ```java
    // 2 ways to block 3rd party cookies
    // Option 1
    options.addArguments("--block-third-party-cookies");
    // Option 2
    
    Map<String, Object> prefs = new HashMap<>();
    prefs.put("profile.block_third_party_cookies", true);
    options.setExperimentalOption("prefs", prefs);
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);
    ```
    

You can follow these above patterns on your test script or test framework. Then you execute all essential test cases to verify the main functionality of your application.
