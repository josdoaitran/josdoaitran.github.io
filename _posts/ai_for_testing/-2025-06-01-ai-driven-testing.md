I have been researching and implementing various AI-powered tools in my daily work as a Quality Engineer for more than 2 years. In this post, I would like to summarize the current trends in applying Artificial Intelligence to Software Testing based on my research and experience. This includes both manual testing activities and automation testing activities, as project managers increasingly seek more powerful tools to accelerate testing speed in their projects.

As a Quality Assurance Engineers, I can evolve into artificial intelligence (AI) strategists, guiding AI-driven test execution while focusing on strategic decisions. 

According to many influencers, rather than replacing testing roles, AI can enhance us:
- AI as an assistent for generate test cases and automatically maitain test cases.
- Automating test maintenance: Auto-healing, Codeless Automation Testing.
- AI as a helper in Impact analysis, Predicting defects, and refining risk-based testing.
This human-AI collaboration is crucial for maintaining quality in increasingly complex software systems.
