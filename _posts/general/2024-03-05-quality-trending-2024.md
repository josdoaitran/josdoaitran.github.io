# Hot keys about Quality

- **Quality Engineer. Transform from QA, QC**
- **Continuous testing - Delivery the new feature quicker**
- **Quality at sale and now Quality at speed**
- **Apply AI on covering the quality of a product**
- **Low Code or No Code for Automation test**

**Contents**

In practically, There are couples of factors impacts on how you should apply those trending on your development team or not.

- The current software development methodology is applying.
- Ways of work
- System architecture (Monolithic or MicroService, â€¦)

# Next approaches to archive the quality trending

The biggest question is: How about the strategy to archive them. Here is some key actions you can consider to apply on your development team

- Automation testing more and aware of the automated testing types:
    - Automated Unit test
    - Automated Integration test
    - Automated component test
    - Automated API test (E2E Test)
    - Automated UI test (E2E Test)

We can consider to follow this approach: Test Pyramid.[https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)

- **Shift Left With Service Virtualization**

Apply more testing in Component testing with some technical techniques like: **Test Double with Mocking or Stubs**.

- Covering more **Component testing** in each Microservice
- Apply **Testing mock, Test Double with Stubs**.

- Do testing with **Contract testing** for API and **Consumer-Driven contract testing** [https://pactflow.io/what-is-consumer-driven-contract-testing/](https://pactflow.io/what-is-consumer-driven-contract-testing/)

- **Continuous testing**: Integrate testing into your pipeline. After merge a new PR, new change, automatically trigger build, automatically trigger test after trigger build successfully.

- Which tools applying **AI model** to do low code for innovation to the next development of automation testing ?
    - Low Code - Visual testing: [**Applitools**](https://applitools.com/)
    - Low Code - Visual testing with: [**Percy**](https://percy.io/)
    - Low powered AU with :  [***Katalon - AI***](https://katalon.com/)
    - Reflect's advanced AI capabilities with **[Reflect Run](https://reflect.run/)**
    - Playwright test with AI: [**ZeroStep**](https://zerostep.com/)
    - Generative AI-based test with [**Testrigor**](https://testrigor.com/)
