# About

In order to practice the essential knowledge about **API testing** (Including manual testing and automation testing). We need to have the example services.
On [API Testing Sharing](https://josdoaitran.github.io/api-sharing-collection/) page, I already mention all free service for learn API testing. However, most of them are based on Mock-Data, it does NOT mimic to real service in real project.

Therefore, I built up a simple API service for tutorial and practicing purpose, how it mimics to real services in functional view.
