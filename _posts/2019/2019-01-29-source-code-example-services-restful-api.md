# About

In order to practice the essential knowledge about **API testing** (Including manual testing and automation testing). We need to have the example services.
On [API Testing Sharing](https://www.notion.so/API-Testing-Sharing-3359bd1c24c64c24830bc1e74fc0127b?pvs=21) page, I already mention all free service for learn API testing. However, most of them are based on Mock-Data, it doesnâ€™t mimic to real service in real project.

Therefore, I built up a simple API service for tutorial and practicing purpose, how it mimics to real services in functional view.
